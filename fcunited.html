					<h1>History</h2>
						<p>The club was founded in 2005 by disenfranchised supporters of Manchester United. Although they had various reasons for their dissatisfaction, the prime catalyst for F.C. United's formation was the 12 May 2005 hostile takeover of Manchester United by the American businessman Malcolm Glazer. After the name "F.C. United" was rejected by The Football Association for being too generic, all those who had pledged money to the club were asked to vote on a name. On 14 June 2005, it was announced that "F.C. United of Manchester" had been chosen, beating "A.F.C. Manchester 1878", "Manchester Central" and "Newton Heath United". "F.C. United" continues to be used as an abbreviated form of the club's name. Karl Marginson was appointed as the club's manager on 22 June 2005, and the club held trials for players on 26 June 2005. Just under 900 players applied to take part in the trials, of whom 200 were selected to do so and 17 were chosen to play for F.C. United. By 6 July 2005, over 4,000 people had pledged money to F.C. United and the club had over Â£100,000 in the bank.</p>

						<p>During their formation, the owners of Leigh RMI asked F.C. United to take over their club, but United refused the takeover offer as they believed that taking over an existing club would be hypocritical, given that F.C. United was formed as a result of Manchester United's takeover. Instead, F.C. United's first game was a friendly match against Leigh RMI on 16 July 2005; the match ended 0&#8208;0.</p>
